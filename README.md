# UnitySmartphone
This was written for Unity version 4.6 as my portfolio piece, immediately after the release of the newest GUI system. There may be bugs in newer versions of Unity.

Features
- Fully functioning home screen for navigating between different apps.
- Currently contains 2 functioning apps, a soundboard and a contacts list.
- Both apps are fully expandable, add extra data and the phone takes care of the rest.
- Fake phone calls are primitive, but work. An example Comma Separated Value (CSV) file has been included with the repository.
- Event handling was being worked on, but was not the main focus of the project so is also primitive.
